# Car-Price-Prediction
I have developed this with python.Used libraries pandas,seaborn and sklearn

1. Understanding the Problem

The objective is to predict car prices based on a set of features such as:

    Year of manufacture
    Mileage
    Engine size (e.g., 1.6L, 2.0L)
    Horsepower (PS)
    Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)
    Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.)
    Number of previous owners

To solve this regression problem, where the target variable is price, I have used supervised machine learning techniques.

2. Dataset

Before building the model, I need a well-prepared dataset. The dataset must consist of the following features for each car:

    Year: The year the car was manufactured.
    Mileage: The total number of miles driven.
    Engine: Engine capacity in liters (e.g., 1.6L).
    PS: Horsepower (performance output of the engine).
    Transmission: Either Manual or Automatic.
    Fuel: Type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, Electric).
    Number_of_Owners: The number of previous owners.
    Price: The target variable, which is the car’s price.

Ensure your dataset is clean, with no missing or invalid values, and that categorical variables (like Transmission and Fuel) are encoded properly.

3. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves transforming raw data into a format that can be used by machine learning algorithms.

Steps:

    Handling Missing Values: If there are any missing values, decide whether to remove them or impute them (e.g., using mean, median, or mode).

    Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical features such as Transmission and Fuel into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

    Feature Scaling: Standardize or normalize numerical features like Mileage, PS, and Engine to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model. Algorithms like linear regression, support vector machines, and neural networks benefit from scaled features.

    Train-Test Split: Split your data into training and test sets, typically in an 80-20 or 70-30 ratio. This helps in evaluating the performance of your model on unseen data.

    4. Model Selection

Since this is a regression problem, I have used Linear regression for this problem:

Machine Learning for Car Price Prediction – README Notes

This document serves as a set of guidelines for developing a car price prediction model using machine learning. The goal of the model is to predict the price of a car based on features such as mileage, engine size, fuel type, and other relevant variables. The following is an outline of the steps you will take to develop this application, along with explanations for each step.
1. Understanding the Problem

    Year of manufacture
    Mileage
    Engine size (e.g., 1.6L, 2.0L)
    Horsepower (PS)
    Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)
    Fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, Electric, etc.)
    Number of previous owners

To solve this regression problem, where the target variable is price, we'll use supervised machine learning techniques.

4. Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of creating new features from existing ones to better represent the underlying patterns in the data.

Some strategies include:

    Age of the Car: Instead of using the Year, you can calculate the car's age by subtracting the year from the current year (e.g., 2024 - Year).
    Price per Year (PPY): Calculate the price divided by the car’s age to see how the value depreciates over time.
    Mileage per Year: Divide Mileage by the car's age to get an annual mileage estimate.

Feature engineering can significantly improve the performance of your model by capturing important patterns.
5. Model Selection

Since this is a regression problem, the following machine learning algorithms can be used:

    Linear Regression: A simple algorithm that assumes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable (price).

    Random Forest Regressor: A powerful ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their outputs. It handles non-linearity and interactions between variables well.

    Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Another ensemble method that focuses on minimizing errors by iteratively improving the model through weak learners.

    Support Vector Regression (SVR): A method that tries to fit the best line within a margin of tolerance for error.

    XGBoost: An advanced boosting algorithm that is highly efficient and often yields excellent performance for regression tasks.

Model Evaluation

    Evaluation Metric: Since this is a regression task, typical metrics include:
        Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
        Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
        R-squared (R²): Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

5. Training the Model

Once you've selected the appropriate model:

    Fit the Model: Train the model on the training dataset using the .fit() method.

    Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search with Cross-Validation to optimize hyperparameters (e.g., the number of trees in a random forest, the learning rate for XGBoost).

    Model Evaluation: Use the test set to evaluate the model’s performance. Check the evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R²) and ensure the model generalizes well on unseen data.
